# Medical Concierge

A recreation of an existing patient management system.

## What is it

This project is built solely as an exercise to reinforce my relearning of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

To demonstrate my skills building a web application from scratch using the core web technologies without relying on a framework.

The application is a simplified representation of a live system, designed to manage patient queues based on ticket numbers issued at a medical facility's concierge.
