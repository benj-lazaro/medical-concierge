# Medical Concierge

A blackbox recreation of a patient management system.

## What is it

This project is a recreated version of a patient management system, built as a learning exercise to reinforce my understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

The application is a simplified representation of the original system, designed to manage patient queues based on unique ticket numbers issues at the medical facility's entrace.

The goal is to demonstrate my skills in building a web-based application from scratch, using the three core technologies.
