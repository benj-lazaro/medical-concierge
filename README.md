# Medical Concierge

A practice project to replicate a real-life web application deployed and used at a local medical facility

## What is it

A web app that manages a queue of patients based on their system-generated number that is issued upon entering the facility.

This helps the staff manage which patient will undergo identity verification, preliminary health check and be appointed to their respective medical consultant.

This is a blackbox attempt to re-create the said app based on visual observation and assumptions.
