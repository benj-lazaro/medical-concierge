# Medical Concierge

A practice project to replicate a real-life web app currently deployed and used at a local medical facility.

## What is it

A web app that manages patients based on their system-generated ticket number issued at the entrance of the facility.

This helps the staff to identity and manage patients who will undergo identity verifications, preliminary health checks or be appointed to their respecive consultant.

This is a blackbox attempt to re-create the app based on assumptions and visual observation.
